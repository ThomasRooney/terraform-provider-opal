# opal_app (Data Source)

An Opal app data source.

## Example Usage

data "opal_app" "opal" {
  id = "dbe38d2d-9ce4-4d13-95a4-945716a257b4"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The ID of the app.

### Read-Only

- `name` (String) The name of the app.
- `type` (String) The type of app.

# Limitations
- Currently, Opal App IDs cannot be read from the terraform provider. You will need to get App IDs from the Opal web app URLs or [via the API](https://docs.opal.dev/reference/getapps).

Please [file a ticket](https://github.com/opalsecurity/terraform-provider-opal/issues) to discuss use cases that are not yet supported in the provider.

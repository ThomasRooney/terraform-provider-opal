# opal_group (Resource)

An Opal Group resource.

## Remote Groups
Remote groups can be managed using the `metadata` and `remote_group_id` attributes. See [this guide](https://docs.opal.dev/reference/how-opal)
for details on how to specify these groups.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "opal_group" "oncall" {
  name = "On-Call Rotation"

  group_type = "OPAL_GROUP"

  # App IDs can be pulled from the URL in the Opal web app,
  # e.g. https://app.opal.dev/apps/dbe38d2d-9ce4-4d13-95a4-945716a257b4#overview
  app_id = "dbe38d2d-9ce4-4d13-95a4-945716a257b4"

  require_mfa_to_approve = true
}
```

Please [file a ticket](https://github.com/opalsecurity/terraform-provider-opal/issues) to discuss use cases that are not yet supported in the provider.

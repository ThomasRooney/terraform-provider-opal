# opal_resource (Resource)

An Opal Resource resource.

## Remote Resources
Remote resources can be managed using the `metadata` and `remote_resource_id` attributes. See [this guide](https://docs.opal.dev/reference/how-opal)
for details on how to specify these resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "opal_resource" "sensitive_resource" {
  name = "Sensitive Resource"
  description = "A sensitive resource that should be accessed for on-call only."

  resource_type = "CUSTOM"

  # App IDs can be pulled from the URL in the Opal web app,
  # e.g. https://app.opal.dev/apps/03c06479-6ffa-45e1-9f65-cd470ff128b3#overview
  app_id = "03c06479-6ffa-45e1-9f65-cd470ff128b3"

  reviewer {
    id = "${opal_owner.security.id}"
  }
}
```

# Limitations
- Currently, Opal App IDs cannot be read from the terraform provider. You will need to get App IDs from the Opal web app URLs.
- [Linked audit channels](https://docs.opal.dev/docs/5526194-slack#linked-reviewer-and-audit-channels) cannot be managed from the terraform provider.
- The `require_mfa_to_connect` attribute is not yet supported.

Please [file a ticket](https://github.com/opalsecurity/terraform-provider-opal/issues) to discuss use cases that are not yet supported in the provider.

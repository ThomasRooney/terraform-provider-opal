# Limitations
- Currently, Opal users can not be managed or read from the terraform provider. You will need
to get User IDs from the Opal web app URLs.
- [Linked audit and reviewer channels](https://docs.opal.dev/docs/5526194-slack#linked-reviewer-and-audit-channels) cannot be managed from the terraform provider.

Please [file a ticket](https://github.com/opalsecurity/terraform-provider-opal/issues) to discuss use cases that are not yet supported in the provider.
